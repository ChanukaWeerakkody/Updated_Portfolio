## Overview

This project involved building a Point of Sale (POS) system for **Mobile Crazy**, a retail and wholesale business specializing in mobile phones and accessories in Bandaragama and Kottawa. The goal was to streamline sales, inventory, and reporting processes, ensuring the client could efficiently manage both retail and bulk transactions in a fast-paced market.

## Key Features

- **Sales & Billing**: Designed a fast and user-friendly billing interface supporting both retail and wholesale transactions.  
- **Inventory Management**: Automated stock tracking for mobile devices and accessories with real-time quantity updates and low-stock alerts.  
- **Customer & Supplier Management**: Integrated modules for managing wholesale clients, retail customers, and suppliers with transaction history tracking.  
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Built dashboards for sales performance, daily/weekly revenue, and stock movement insights.  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Deployed independent services for sales, inventory, and reporting, ensuring scalability and fault isolation.  
- **Multi-Branch Support**: Enabled expansion readiness by supporting operations across multiple store locations.  

## Technologies Used

- **Java Spring Boot**: For building scalable backend microservices.  
- **MySQL**: For secure, relational data storage and reporting.  
- **React**: For a responsive and intuitive frontend experience.  
- **Microservice Architecture**: For modular, maintainable, and scalable system design.  
- **POS Hardware Integration**: Configured compatibility with receipt printers, barcode scanners, and cash drawers.  
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation and version control.  

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was handling **dual pricing models** (retail vs. wholesale) while keeping stock records unified. Another complexity was ensuring **real-time synchronization** between branches to avoid stock mismatches. These were solved through optimized database structuring, efficient query design, and microservices communication patterns with robust background workers.

## Outcome

The POS system improved operational efficiency by **50%**, reduced stock discrepancies, and provided Mobile Crazy with accurate sales insights. Retail staff benefited from faster checkout times, while wholesale clients gained a more reliable purchasing experience. The system positioned the business to scale seamlessly as it expands operations.
