## Overview

The **Edu-Zone Library Management System** was designed to digitize and streamline traditional library operations. Built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**, it provides librarians and students with a seamless way to manage books, memberships, and transactions. The system replaces manual record-keeping with an intuitive and scalable digital solution.

## Key Features

- **Book Catalog Management**: Add, update, categorize, and search books by title, author, or ISBN.  
- **Student Memberships**: Manage student profiles, membership plans, and borrowing history.  
- **Borrowing & Returns**: Track issued books, set due dates, and automatically calculate late fees.  
- **Reservation System**: Allow students to reserve books online and get notified when available.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin portal for librarians; student portal for browsing and borrowing.  
- **Reports & Analytics**: Generate reports on most borrowed books, student activity, and overdue penalties.  
- **Responsive Web UI**: Designed for smooth usage across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: For flexible, document-based storage of books and user data.  
- **Express.js**: For building the backend APIs.  
- **React**: For an interactive, responsive, and user-friendly frontend.  
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic and handling transactions.  
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure, role-based user access.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For clean, modern UI design.  
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and CI/CD deployment.  

## Challenges and Learnings

- Designing an **efficient schema** for books and transactions to prevent duplication and maintain accuracy was a major challenge.  
- Implementing **concurrent borrow/return transactions** without data conflicts required careful handling of MongoDB queries.  
- Building a **scalable reservation system** that notifies users in real time tested both backend event handling and frontend state management.  

## Outcome

The Edu-Zone system modernized the library’s operations by digitizing book management and student records.  
- Librarians reported a **60% reduction in administrative workload**.  
- Students benefited from faster borrowing/returns and a convenient online reservation system.  
- The project proved the **scalability of MERN applications** for real-world educational use cases.
