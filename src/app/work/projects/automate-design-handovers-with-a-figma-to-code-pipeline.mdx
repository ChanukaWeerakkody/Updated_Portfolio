## Overview

This project was built for a **local fisheries operation near Ambalangoda beach**, where a group of fishermen manage multiple boats, employees, and fish sales. Traditionally, all operations were tracked manually, leading to inefficiencies and errors. The goal was to **digitize the entire workflow**—from managing boats and employees to recording daily catch and sales.

## Key Features

- **Boat & Crew Management**: Track each boat, its assigned crew, and fishing schedules.  
- **Fish Catch & Sales Tracking**: Log daily catch quantities, record sales (retail + wholesale), and manage buyer details.  
- **Employee Management**: Maintain records of employees, wages, and work assignments.  
- **Inventory & Storage**: Monitor storage capacity, ice usage, and stock movement in real time.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate dashboards for admins, boat owners, and employees.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Generate reports on daily catch, revenue, employee wages, and seasonal trends.  

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: For building a modular, scalable backend API.  
- **MongoDB**: For handling unstructured and fast-changing fisheries data efficiently.  
- **React**: For an interactive and responsive frontend interface.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For simple yet scalable UI design.  
- **REST APIs**: For smooth client-server communication.  
- **Docker**: For containerized deployments ensuring scalability and easy maintenance.  

## Challenges and Learnings

- Managing **frequent data changes** (daily fish catches and sales) required an efficient schema design in MongoDB to prevent performance issues.  
- Synchronizing **employee wage calculations** with irregular fishing schedules introduced complex logic, which was solved using **NestJS services and cron jobs**.  
- Ensuring the system could work **offline-first** (in case of unstable beachside internet) required local storage strategies with sync mechanisms.  

## Outcome

The system **eliminated manual record-keeping**, reducing errors and saving significant administrative time.  
- Fishermen and managers gained **real-time visibility** into sales and operations.  
- Employees received **transparent wage tracking** based on actual work.  
- The client reported a **40% improvement in operational efficiency** within the first two months of adoption.
