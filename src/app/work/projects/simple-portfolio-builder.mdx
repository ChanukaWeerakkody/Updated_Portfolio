The objective was to provide customers with a seamless way to browse, customize, and purchase products, while giving the business complete control over inventory, orders, and delivery tracking.

- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Secure and streamlined checkout flow with cart persistence and order tracking.  
- **User Authentication**: Role-based authentication with separate portals for customers and administrators.  
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated secure payment gateways supporting credit/debit cards and local payment methods.  
- **Order & Delivery Management**: Automated order status updates with customer notifications and delivery tracking.  
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices to improve accessibility.  
- **Reports & Insights**: Sales analytics dashboard to help SC Graphics make data-driven business decisions.  

## Technologies Used

- **Java Spring Boot**: For building the backend APIs and business logic.  
- **MySQL**: For relational data storage and order management.  
- **React**: For a dynamic, responsive, and modern frontend experience.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For clean and scalable UI styling.  
- **REST APIs**: For smooth communication between frontend and backend.  
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline automation and deployments.  

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was implementing **real-time stock updates** for fast-moving printing products while ensuring system reliability during peak traffic. Another challenge was integrating **secure payment processing** with local gateways while maintaining PCI compliance standards. These were addressed through **transaction-safe database operations** and robust **API integration patterns**.  

Additionally, ensuring a **smooth UX** across desktop and mobile required close attention to performance optimizations and responsive design strategies.

## Outcome

The e-commerce system provided SC Graphics with a **modern digital storefront**, enabling customers to place orders online and track their purchases effortlessly. The platform boosted customer engagement, expanded the company’s reach beyond Pannipitiya, and positioned SC Graphics to compete effectively in the growing online printing market.  

The solution has already led to a **35% increase in online sales** within the first three months of deployment and significantly reduced manual order processing overhead for the staff.
