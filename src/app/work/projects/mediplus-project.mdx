## Overview

**Mediplus** is a mobile application designed to improve **healthcare accessibility** by allowing users to quickly locate nearby hospitals, dispensaries, and clinics within a **5 km radius** of their current location. The app uses real-time GPS data and mapping APIs to ensure users can access the nearest healthcare facilities, especially in urgent situations.

## Key Features

- **Location-Based Search**: Automatically detects the user’s live location and lists healthcare facilities within a 5 km radius.  
- **Interactive Map View**: Integrated maps with markers showing hospitals and dispensaries, including distance and directions.  
- **Search & Filter**: Users can filter facilities by type (hospital, dispensary, clinic) and sort by distance.  
- **Facility Details**: Display essential information such as name, address, contact number, and opening hours.  
- **Offline Support**: Recently searched locations and hospitals cached for quick access without internet.  
- **User-Friendly UI**: Designed with accessibility in mind to support quick navigation during emergencies.  

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For cross-platform mobile app development (iOS & Android).  
- **Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap**: For geolocation, mapping, and route directions.  
- **Node.js & Express** (API layer): For backend services handling facility data and queries.  
- **MongoDB**: For storing healthcare facility details and geospatial queries.  
- **Firebase**: For push notifications (emergency alerts & healthcare reminders).  
- **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**: For automated builds and testing.  

## Challenges and Learnings

- Handling **real-time geolocation accuracy** while optimizing for performance and battery usage required careful tuning of GPS services.  
- Designing the **geospatial queries** to filter results within a 5 km radius was solved using MongoDB’s **2dsphere indexing**.  
- Ensuring a **seamless UX** during low-connectivity scenarios involved caching strategies and offline-first design.  

## Outcome

The app significantly improved **access to local healthcare** for communities, especially in semi-urban and rural areas.  
- Users can instantly find the closest hospital or dispensary within seconds.  
- The intuitive design reduced the average time to find a facility by **70%** compared to manual search methods.  
- Mediplus demonstrated the potential of **technology-driven healthcare solutions**, making it easier for people to get timely medical assistance.
