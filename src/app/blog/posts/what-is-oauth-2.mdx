## Introduction to OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization, enabling applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

## Why OAuth 2.0 Matters

1. **Security**: Reduces the need to store user credentials
2. **User Experience**: Simplifies the login process
3. **Standardization**: Widely adopted across major platforms
4. **Granular Permissions**: Users can control what data they share

## Core Concepts

### 1. Roles in OAuth 2.0
- Resource Owner (User)
- Client (Application)
- Resource Server (API)
- Authorization Server

### 2. Grant Types
- Authorization Code
- Implicit
- Resource Owner Password Credentials
- Client Credentials

### 3. Tokens
- Access Tokens
- Refresh Tokens
- ID Tokens (OpenID Connect)

## Common Use Cases
- Social login (Sign in with Google, Facebook, etc.)
- API authorization
- Mobile and desktop application authentication
- Server-to-server authentication

## Best Practices
1. Always use HTTPS
2. Store tokens securely
3. Implement proper token expiration and refresh
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Keep your OAuth libraries updated

## Conclusion

Understanding OAuth 2.0 is crucial for modern web developers. It's the backbone of secure authentication and authorization in today's interconnected web services. By implementing OAuth 2.0 correctly, you can provide a secure and seamless experience for your users.
