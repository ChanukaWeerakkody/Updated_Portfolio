## Introduction

Backend APIs are the lifeblood of applications. In 2025, REST, GraphQL, and gRPC remain dominantâ€”but each serves different needs.

## 1. REST â€“ The Universal Standard

Best for simple, resource-based APIs with wide adoption and tooling.

## 2. GraphQL â€“ Flexible Queries

Allows clients to request exactly what they need, reducing over-fetching. Great for frontend-heavy apps.

## 3. gRPC â€“ High-Performance Communication

Ideal for microservices and low-latency systems. Uses HTTP/2 and Protobuf for efficiency.

## 4. Hybrid Approaches

Many modern systems combine REST for external APIs, GraphQL for UI queries, and gRPC for internal services.

## Conclusion

No single winnerâ€”choose REST for simplicity, GraphQL for flexibility, and gRPC for performance.
