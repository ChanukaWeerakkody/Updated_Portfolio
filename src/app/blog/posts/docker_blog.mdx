## Introduction

Containerization is no longer optional. In 2025, Docker remains widely used, but alternatives and orchestration tools dominate production environments.

## 1. Docker in Development, Kubernetes in Production

Use Docker for local dev, but rely on Kubernetes for scaling workloads.

## 2. Podman & Buildah

Podman offers rootless containers, providing improved security over Docker.

## 3. Container Security Best Practices

Use image scanning tools (Trivy, Clair) and avoid running containers as root.

## 4. Multi-Stage Builds

Reduce image sizes with optimized multi-stage builds for faster CI/CD pipelines.

## 5. Serverless Containers

Platforms like AWS Fargate and Google Cloud Run allow containers without managing infra.

## Conclusion

Containers continue to evolve, and in 2025, the winning formula is lightweight development (Docker/Podman) + powerful orchestration (Kubernetes/Serverless).
