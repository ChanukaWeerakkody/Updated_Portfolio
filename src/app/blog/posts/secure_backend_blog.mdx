## Introduction

API attacks are at an all-time high. In 2025, securing backend APIs requires layered strategies combining authentication, authorization, and monitoring.

## 1. Zero Trust Principles

Never trust by default‚Äîvalidate every request with strong identity checks.

## 2. OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect

Use modern token-based authentication standards for secure access.

## 3. API Gateways & Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse with throttling, quotas, and WAF integration.

## 4. Data Encryption

Use TLS 1.3 for transport security and encrypt sensitive fields at rest.

## 5. Continuous Security Testing

Integrate tools like OWASP ZAP and Snyk into CI/CD pipelines.

## Conclusion

Securing APIs in 2025 is proactive, automated, and continuous‚Äîsecurity must be built into the entire lifecycle.
