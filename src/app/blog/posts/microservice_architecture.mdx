## Introduction

Choosing the right backend architecture is critical. In 2025, monoliths, microservices, and serverless remain relevant—but serve different business needs.

## 1. Monoliths – Simple but Limited

Great for startups with small teams. Easier to deploy but harder to scale independently.

## 2. Microservices – Scalability at a Cost

Best for large systems with domain separation, but requires expertise in DevOps and observability.

## 3. Serverless – Pay as You Go

Perfect for event-driven workloads and unpredictable traffic. Watch out for cold starts and vendor lock-in.

## 4. Hybrid Models

Many teams mix monoliths (core system), microservices (scalable domains), and serverless (event-driven tasks).

## Conclusion

There’s no one-size-fits-all. The right architecture depends on your team size, scalability needs, and budget.
