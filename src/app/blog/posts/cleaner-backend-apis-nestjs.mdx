## Introduction

Building robust and maintainable backend APIs is crucial for any application's success. In this post, we'll explore how NestJS can help you achieve cleaner, more organized, and scalable backend code.

## 1. Leverage Dependency Injection

NestJS's built-in dependency injection system helps manage dependencies and makes your code more testable and maintainable.

## 2. Use Custom Pipes for Validation

Move your validation logic into reusable pipes to keep your controllers clean and focused on handling requests.

## 3. Implement Guards for Authorization

Use guards to handle authentication and authorization in a clean, reusable way.

## 4. Create Custom Decorators

Reduce code duplication by creating custom decorators for common patterns.

## 5. Organize Code by Domain

Structure your application by feature modules to keep related functionality together.

## 6. Use Interceptors for Cross-Cutting Concerns

Handle logging, caching, and other cross-cutting concerns with interceptors.

## 7. Implement Proper Error Handling

Create a consistent error handling strategy using exception filters.

## Conclusion

By following these practices, you can create more maintainable, testable, and scalable backend APIs with NestJS.
